  summary: HsM Client Service API for business data synchronization
  description: |-
    ## General description

    This API is used to synchronize business data resources with external systems. Once authenticated a process using this API is authorized to access any endpoint without restrictions.

    The Standard API is a client agnostic API to the HsM Client Service.

    ## Notes for developers

    ### i18N and Accept-Language header
    All operations will respect Accept-Language headers. If the operation has to handle localizable content it will do so respecting the Accept-Language header. This includes formatting of culture-specific data, sorting, language-specific content (phrases) etc.

    ### Responses
    This specification shows only the most relevant responses. Clients have to still handle all other possible HTTP Response codes.

    ### Id and synchronizationId
    As this API covers the special use case of data synchronization, resources can be identified with either their internal HsM Id (an Int32) or a synchronizationId (a UUID). The service will try to parse the ID into one of the two types and will identify the resource accordingly.
